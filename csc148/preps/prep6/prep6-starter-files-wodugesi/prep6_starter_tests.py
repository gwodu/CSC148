=== Module description ===
This module contains sample tests for Prep 6.

Complete the TODO in this file.

When writing a test case, make sure you create a new function, with its
name starting with "test_". For example:

def test_my_test_case():
    # Your test here
"""
from prep6 import num_positives, nested_max, max_length

def test_max_length_int() -> None:
    """Test max_length on an int, ie base case"""
    assert max_length(2) == 0

def test_max_length_empty_list() -> None:
    """Test max_length on an empty list"""
    assert max_length([]) == 0

def test_max_length_nested() -> None:
    """Test max_length on a nested list of only integers"""
    assert max_length([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])


# Below are provided sample test cases for your use. You are encouraged
# to add additional test cases (in addition to the ones required above.)
# WARNING: THIS IS AN EXTREMELY INCOMPLETE SET OF TESTS!
# Add your own to practice writing tests and to be confident your code is
# correct.
def test_num_positives_doctest_example() -> None:
    """Test num_positive on one of the given doctest examples."""
    assert num_positives([1, -2, [-10, 2, [3], 4, -5], 4]) == 5


def test_nested_max_doctest_example() -> None:
    """Test nested_max on one of the given doctest examples."""
    assert nested_max([1, 2, [1, 2, [3], 4, 5], 4]) == 5


def test_max_length_doctest_example() -> None:
