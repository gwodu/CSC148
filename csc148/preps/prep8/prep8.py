=== Module Description ===
Your task in this prep is to implement each of the unimplemented Tree methods
in this file.

The starter code has a recursive template that treats both the "empty tree"
and the "size-one" tree ("leaf") as base cases.  You may not need both of these
base cases -- it depends on the method you are writing.  If you can, collapse
down to just one base case.
