Q4: ADTs [10 marks]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i) [2 marks] Your classmate says that "There's no difference between Queues and
Python lists!". Using the concept of abstract data types, explain whether your
classmate is correct or incorrect.

TODO: Answer part (i)
An abstract data type defines some kind of data and the actions that can be performed on it
Queues differ from Python lists by virtue of their implementation. The way queues were implemented
in class, information was removed in the same order as it was inserted, using the methods enqueue and
dequeue. The user could also tell if the queue was empty by using the is_empty method. But python lists are
implemented differently, for example, items can be inserted at and removed from particular places in the list
because of pyhton list's index attributes. So python lists and queues differ by virtue of their difference in information storage and retrieval.


(ii) For an ordered assortment of <n> values, indicate whether a Linked List
or a Python List is the better choice to store these values for each of the
following scenarios (a, b, c). Explain your answers for each.

    a. [2 marks] an application that frequently requires insertions at the
       last index and deletions at the first index (i.e. index 0)

        TODO: Answer a.
        Queue would be best since the enqueue method appends to the end of the queue
        and the dequeue removes the item at the front of the list

    b. [2 marks] an application that frequently requires indexing (i.e. access
       the value at an index <i>)

        TODO: Answer b.
        The python list would be better because items are stored contiguously,
        therefore python's indexing could run at virtually constant time.

    c. [2 marks] an application that frequently requires searching whether a
       value is present

       TODO: Answer c.
       Both queue and python lists would be approximately equally capable since each item in both
       data sets would have to be iterated through.

(v) [2 marks] For the standard Stack and Queue implementations provided in
class, indicate the printed output once the code below has finished executing.
Assume that the Stack and Queue classes have been imported correctly.
