Question 3 [6 marks]
=====================

This question includes several small short-answer questions.

Below is a function that is missing most of its docstring. You will provide additional pieces.
def do_something(q1: Queue, q2: Queue) -> Queue:
    """
    Precondition: q1 and q2 contain only ints.
    """
    q = Queue()
    while not q1.is_empty():
        item1 = q1.dequeue()
        item2 = q2.dequeue()
        if item1 > item2:
            q.enqueue(item1)
        else:
            q.enqueue(item2)
    return q


Part (a) [2 marks]
-------------------
What additional preconditions are needed to ensure the function does not raise an error. If none are
necessary, write “None”.
len(q2) >= len(q1)




Part (b) [2 marks]
-------------------
Write an English description of the function, suitable for the docstring. Assume all preconditions are met.
Compares each item in q1 and q2 in pairs(ie. comparing
the first of each, and the second of each, and so on) until q1 is empty
 and enqueues the bigger of each comparison pair in the new queue q, which is
 returned




Part (c) [2 marks]
-------------------
Complete this one doctest example so that it demonstrates all aspects of what the function does. You may
continue your answer in a second column if needed.
    >>> stuff = Queue()
    >>> stuff.enqueue(3)
    >>> stuff.enqueue(61)
    >>> stuff.enqueue(10)
    >>> stuff2 = Queue()
    >>> stuff2.enqueue(4)
    >>> stuff2.enqueue(1)
    >>> stuff2.enqueue(11)
    >>> do_something(stuff, stuff2)
    [4, 61, 11]
